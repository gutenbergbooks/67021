<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>NOTICE
TO THE READER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sermon here presented to the
Public is below all criticism.&nbsp; It makes no pretensions to
novelty, or to merit of any kind; it is only one of the thousands
which are preached every week by men, who, in the midst of evil
report, labour, nevertheless, with an anxious zeal for the
salvation of souls.&nbsp; It was composed in haste, with no
intention of printing it, for a sequestered parish, where much
remains of ancient simplicity; but where the author lamented to
see, as he thought, a neglect of public worship, not occasioned
by infidelity, or by profligacy, as in great towns, but by
ignorance of the subject, or thoughtlessness of conduct.</p>
<p>The inclemency of the weather having prevented him from
preaching it at the time intended, and no other opportunity being
likely to occur for many months, he determined to print it at <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>once for the
use of his parishioners; but some other little tracts of his,
with the same limited object, having been called for by persons
desirous of doing good in their several spheres, and on a larger
scale, he thinks it possible that they may wish to have
<i>this</i> also, and therefore he publishes it.</p>
<p>The subject of the sermon, in these days especially, is a
momentous one.&nbsp; May God bless it, for the sake of the
subject, to his own glory, and to the benefit of men!&nbsp; The
author has no other wish.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
SABBATH.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Exod. xx. 8.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Remember the
Sabbath-day</i>, <i>to keep it holy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> command, to remember the
Sabbath-day, in order to keep it holy, was given by Almighty God
himself to the Jews.&nbsp; I say, it was given by himself.&nbsp;
He did not order any prophet, or other holy man, to give it in
<i>his</i> name; He gave it himself in his own person; He spoke
it aloud, in the ears of all the people, with his own
voice.&nbsp; And this voice, as we are told, was so terrible,
that the hearers of it were smitten with intolerable fear and
trembling, and began to entreat, with the most humble and urgent
supplications, that God would vouchsafe, in future, to make known
his will to them by the voice of Moses rather than by his
own.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>No
doubt, <i>we</i> also, who are assembled here, should think it a
very awful thing, and should tremble in our whole frame, if we
were to hear the voice of the great God of heaven and earth
speaking to us from a cloud, or from a mountain-top; and we
should naturally desire to hear the gentler, the more familiar
voice of a man, like one of ourselves; to whom also we might
listen, and with whom we might talk and reason, without any
dismay, or even alarm.&nbsp; However, in this case, we may
presume, the mighty terror of God&rsquo;s voice was increased
tenfold to those who heard it, by the accompanying hoarse blast
of the brazen trumpet, waxing louder and louder; by the continual
crash of tremendous thunderings; and by the red, fiery flashes of
direful lightnings, which burst around them, whilst God was
speaking, out of the thick, dark smoke that covered the top of
the mountain &ldquo;where God was;&rdquo; the whole mountain
itself, too, shook from its very foundations, and seemed to be
all in a flame, burning with fire.</p>
<p>Now, what was the reason of this unusual manifestation of the
Divine Majesty, but that God wished to give the command in the
most striking, impressive manner, so that it should never be
forgotten by <i>that</i> generation of men; and to show <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>them a
terrific instance of his power also, that they might tremble at
the very thought of disobeying him, and of profaning, or
neglecting, the Sabbath-day, which he <i>thus</i> commanded them
to remember, to keep it holy.</p>
<p>But this was not all.&nbsp; God was not satisfied that He had
done enough, even when He had uttered this command with his own
voice, and with all that show of his terrible power and majesty;
He wrote it also on a tablet of stone with his own finger; and He
ordered the sacred tablet to be preserved with the utmost care,
in the most sacred place&mdash;in the very ark where his whole
covenant with his chosen people was preserved also.&nbsp; One
generation alone could have heard that voice, and have seen those
miraculous signs; but many succeeding generations, to remote
times, might see the tablet of stone, and read the writing of
God&rsquo;s finger, and learn the Divine will for themselves with
a more reverential awe; whilst every other supernatural
circumstance of the history was taught by one generation to
another, and was handed down from father to son through
<i>all</i> generations.</p>
<p>You may readily now understand, then, of what vast importance
this command must be in the eye of God, and how necessary the
observance of it is <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>for the welfare and happiness of man.&nbsp; For, if this
were not so&mdash;if it made no difference, either to God&rsquo;s
own glory, or to <i>our</i> welfare and happiness, whether the
Sabbath-day were remembered to keep it holy or not; it is
difficult to conceive that God should have taken so much pains,
as it were, to establish a Sabbath-day at all; by descending, as
He did, from heaven upon the Mount, in the midst of lightnings,
and thunderings, and an earthquake; by proclaiming it to the
astonished, trembling multitude with his own voice; by writing
it, besides, with his own finger; and by ordering it to be laid
up in the ark as a divine ordinance for ever.</p>
<p>But how does all this apply to other nations, and to
<i>us</i>, of <i>this</i> nation, and of <i>this</i> age?&nbsp;
God gave the command in this miraculous manner to the Jews only;
how do <i>we</i> know that He intended that <i>we</i>, and all
mankind, should observe it to the end of time?</p>
<p>This is a very reasonable question, and it may have a very
satisfactory answer; namely, that the same causes for a
Sabbath-day, and for remembering it, to keep it holy for ever,
concern alike all the rest of mankind as well as the Jews; and
that <i>we</i> Christians, above others, have especial cause for
hallowing our own Sabbath-day; such as neither <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the Jews, nor
the rest of mankind, until they become Christians, <i>can</i>
have for hallowing their&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If it were <i>their</i>
bounden duty to hallow Saturday, or any other day, much more is
it <i>ours</i> to hallow Sunday.</p>
<p>In truth, the ordinance of a Sabbath, to be kept holy to the
Lord, is of the same age and antiquity with the creation of the
world itself.&nbsp; It was not first established amongst the
Jews; it was only renewed and re-established amongst <i>them</i>,
when they themselves, like the heathens, had forgotten, or
neglected it.&nbsp; It was established as early as with Adam, the
first man, even in Paradise; and, therefore, all the sons of
Adam&mdash;that is, the whole race of mankind, and not the Jews
only, are equally bound to keep it.&nbsp; By proclaiming it to
the Jews, as He did, God shows to us how awfully we ought to
think of it; but all the nations of the world, which existed
before, were bound by it before; and all which have existed
since, and exist now, <i>have</i> been, and <i>are</i>, bound by
it, in consequence of their common descent from Adam, to whom it
was declared in the beginning, and made a law to his whole
posterity for ever.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if God himself had said nothing about it, it
would have been the duty of man, the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>rational creature of God, and
indebted to God for so many blessings&mdash;for so many noble
powers and faculties, to have set apart some portion of the time
which God gave him to the especial honour of the bountiful
Giver&mdash;to have employed that time solely in thanking him for
his precious gifts and his gracious providence&mdash;in
meditating upon his glorious perfections and his marvellous
works&mdash;and in serving and worshipping him by all other
means, with such peculiar, extraordinary tokens of love, and
gratitude, and veneration, as would not have been possible, or
not suitable, at every time, and in every place; but only at the
appointed time, and in some appointed place.</p>
<p>This, I say, would have been the duty of man, if left entirely
to the use of his own reason.&nbsp; But no individual
<i>could</i> have determined for himself, and still less were all
men likely to agree with each other, what the portion of time to
be set apart for this purpose should be; how much the beneficent
Author of their being, and of all their enjoyments, would expect
of them to consecrate to him; and how often the consecrated time
should return, so as to please God, and draw down from above his
further blessings upon them.</p>
<p>This, then, which <i>we</i> should have been quite unable to
decide for ourselves, God has decided <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>for us.&nbsp; He has himself, in his
infinite wisdom, determined what is fit and proper both for
<i>us</i> and for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; He has not put us under the
necessity of reasoning upon so important a matter at all; from
the very beginning He appointed it for an everlasting law, that
the portion of time to be dedicated to his especial service and
worship should be one day out of every seven days: that six
successive days should be <i>ours</i> for labour of body and of
mind, and for all the needful business of this present life; that
the seventh day should be <i>his</i>, for a holy rest unto the
Lord&mdash;for celebrating his wondrous works&mdash;and for a
more quiet, undisturbed consideration of our own immortal
concerns, and all the spiritual business of the life which is to
come hereafter.</p>
<p>But the seventh day, then, if we will use it thus, is
<i>ours</i> as well as <i>his</i>; it is <i>ours</i> more than
all the six which go before: it is <i>ours</i> in its own
sublime, peculiar sense, to give us a foretaste of eternity by
withdrawing us from temporal things; in short, it is one of the
best gifts of God to man.&nbsp; O taste and see how gracious the
Lord is!&nbsp; The Sabbath is to his own glory; but what would
man be without it?&nbsp; The most wretched of beings in every
way; worn out before his usual allotted time with unintermitted
toils; brought <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>down to the grave by a premature old age and decay; and,
what is still worse for him, with diminished hopes of happiness
in another and a better world.&nbsp; The Sabbath, thanks be to
God! brings with it, if we will, a sweet, a tranquil, a
refreshing rest: it repairs and renews the languishing, the
broken powers of body and of mind; it sends us forth again to our
duties on the following day with new strength, and a new spirit,
more adequate to the performance of them; cheerfulness sits upon
our brow, instead of a perpetual gloom; health, instead of the
sad hue of a thousand maladies, which never-ending, never-pausing
labour must have necessarily produced.&nbsp; And if the Sabbath
has been spent as God intends that it should be spent, no small
advance has been made towards some happy mansion in our eternal
abode.&nbsp; We have heard, we have read, we have thought much
about our blessed Redeemer&mdash;about our own
salvation&mdash;about the bliss and glory of heaven.&nbsp; We
have put ourselves into every way, private and public, of
receiving every grace of which we stand in need, and which God,
through Christ, has promised to bestow.&nbsp; We have prayed more
at home than the business of the world will permit us to do on
any other day; we have assembled in the church, as often as the
church was open, to receive <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the mercies to which we are entitled,
by God&rsquo;s gift, only as we are members of the church; we
have confessed our sins there with bended knees and a penitent
heart; we have said with heartfelt thankfulness,
&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; to the covenanted pardon of God announced by
the minister of Christ; we have partaken of all the divine
ordinances blameless; if the holy table was decked, we have
feasted upon the heavenly banquet of our great Saviour&rsquo;s
body and blood.&nbsp; These have been the holy deeds of the
well-spent day; and holy deeds like these will qualify us for the
rewards of eternity, if, under the continued influence of the
Holy Spirit, encouraging, strengthening, and sanctifying us, we
persevere unshaken in the same course to the end.&nbsp; The
Sabbath-day, then, is ours more especially; God, in consecrating
and hallowing it to himself, has done so to <i>our</i> present
and eternal profit.&nbsp; By means of it we perform the better
all the business of men, all the business of Christians, all the
business of those who aspire to heaven.</p>
<p>Now, there can be no doubt, but that God, being infinitely
wise, and also most intimately acquainted with the peculiar wants
and infirmities, and with the whole nature of man, whom he
himself created, and upon whom he bestowed what nature he
pleased, foreknew, and therefore decided <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>from the very
first, that one-seventh of man&rsquo;s time was <i>necessary</i>
to be, and consequently <i>should</i> be, released from labour,
and devoted to a holy rest.&nbsp; But the way which he took to
show this to <i>us</i>, and to give us, at the same time, an
awful and striking sense of it, is perhaps one of the most
wonderful instances of all the wonders of his providential care
of us.&nbsp; He himself, in his mighty work of the creation of
this world, tasked himself to a six-days&rsquo; labour, and
rested on the seventh day, in order that man, following
<i>his</i> example, might use the same proportion of labour and
rest.</p>
<p>And this He has told us in his holy word; He has not left it
to <i>us</i> to find it out by our own reason; He has informed us
himself.&nbsp; It had been easy for <i>him</i>, for Omnipotence,
surely, to have made the world, and all the creatures that fill,
diversify, and adorn it, in a single day; nay, in a single hour;
yes, truly, in a single minute.&nbsp; As He said, &ldquo;let
there be light, and there was light;&rdquo; so He had only to
say, &ldquo;let there be a world,&rdquo; and there would have
been a world.&nbsp; In a single instant of time, in the very
twinkling of an eye, all the miracles of creation that are
visible to <i>us</i>, and all that are invisible, beyond the ken
even of our imagination, at the Divine fiat, at the simple sound
of the omnific word, would have <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>sprung into existence at once, and
into all the well-being, order, and harmony, by which all things
will consist, in the same beauty and perfection, unto the
end.&nbsp; But then there would have been nothing in such a
proceeding for the moral instruction, or for the temporal and
eternal benefit of men.&nbsp; He set bounds, therefore, to his
own boundless power; He reduced infinite down to finite; He
controlled his own almighty energies, and ordered his work, a
whole world, so as to finish it in six days; He knew that a
seventh day of rest was needful for man; and, therefore, He
bestowed it upon him as a merciful boon, secured to him
indefeasibly for ever by the express pattern of his own doings,
and by the positive command to copy that pattern throughout all
ages.</p>
<p>Now let us see, then, how we stand as Christians.&nbsp; Do you
think it likely, however, that so merciful a religion, as that of
Christ, should take this merciful ordinance of the Sabbath from
us?&nbsp; Do you think it likely that the same God, who, under
the law, ordained a Sabbath, even for the miserable brute
creation, that the poor cattle might rest from their labours as
well as their rich owners, should abolish it under the
gospel?&nbsp; Of all incredible things this would be the most
incredible, that God should care so much for beasts, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>which perish,
as to provide <i>them</i> a temporary repose from bodily toil,
and none for man, who has an immortal soul to be saved, or lost,
for ever; after having redeemed him, too, by the most astonishing
method of the sacrifice of his own beloved Son.&nbsp; O they of
little faith, who reason thus!&nbsp; But, blessed be God! it is
not so.&nbsp; As Christians, we are still the posterity of Adam;
and, if we partake, alas! of all the evils that sprung from Adam,
at least we partake of this one benefit.&nbsp; Sin has not
deprived us of it, but made it the more necessary for us.&nbsp;
Again, as Christians, we are not indeed the posterity of Abraham,
according to the flesh; and, therefore, we are not necessarily
under any part of the law given to the Jews; except it might have
pleased the Author and Finisher of our faith to adopt any part of
it into his gospel.&nbsp; But this he most clearly did with
respect to the ten commandments, of which the hallowing of the
Sabbath is one.&nbsp; He fulfilled and abolished every thing
ceremonial, which concerned the Jews only; he retained, and gave
a new force and sanctity to every thing moral, which concerns all
mankind; and, without doubt, it is in every view a moral duty,
that the thing made should worship the great Maker, on solemn
days, which shall often return&mdash;that they should return, as
they do, on <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>every seventh day, we owe to God&rsquo;s gracious
providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sabbath,&rdquo; as our Lord
beautifully and mercifully said, &ldquo;was made for man;&rdquo;
and, consequently, whilst man remains upon this earth, a stranger
and a pilgrim, travelling along a weary, rugged road, towards
some better country in the distant prospect before him, the
Sabbath too remains; on the authority of our blessed Saviour it
remains, to refresh us all on our journey; to support and comfort
us under the fatigue of it; and to cheer us with the thought of
the everlasting Sabbath in heaven, of which it is the type and
the shadow.</p>
<p>And this it does the more effectually, because <i>we</i>
Christians keep <i>our</i> Sabbath on our own Lord&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; The Jews keep <i>theirs</i> on the day of their
wonderful deliverance from bondage in Egypt; and very
properly.&nbsp; But <i>their</i> deliverance from bondage in
Egypt was the type and shadow of <i>our</i> grander deliverance
from the bondage of sin and death; which deliverance was then
most evidently and undeniably accomplished, when our Saviour
triumphed openly over both, by rising from the grave, alive and
victorious.&nbsp; Well do we call the first day of the week, the
revered day on which he did it, the Lord&rsquo;s day; and well
have all Christians ever since, assured of their redemption <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>by his
resurrection on that day, consecrated and hallowed it for
<i>their</i> Sabbath for ever.&nbsp; So that now all the reasons
which could ever have operated amongst mankind for the keeping of
a Sabbath, and still more reasons, operate upon <i>us</i>
Christians.&nbsp; We keep one day in seven in memory of the
creation, as the rest of men should do; but we keep <i>that</i>
day, in preference to all others, which reminds us, more forcibly
than any other, of our second creation; of our being begotten
again to a new life; of our more interesting creation in true
righteousness and holiness, after having fallen from the divine
image of the holy Creator himself.&nbsp; And, as <i>our</i>
sacred religion is founded upon the religion of the Jews, and was
shadowed out and prefigured by it, we are naturally led from the
antitype to the type; from the thing prefigured and shadowed out
to the thing prefiguring and shadowing it; and we look back with
reverence to the Jewish Sabbath, so awfully and terrifically
appointed, which commemorated on a chosen day a great temporal
deliverance of <i>theirs</i>, prefiguring a still greater
spiritual deliverance of <i>ours</i>.</p>
<p>What shall we now say, then, my beloved, Christian
brethren?&nbsp; Shall we not remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it
holy?&nbsp; And how shall we <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>keep it holy, if we employ ourselves
on <i>that</i>, as on other days?&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sabbath was
made for man;&rdquo; but how was it made for him, if he labours,
as on the other six days; if he pursues the same worldly objects,
and torments himself with the same anxious cares; if he chooses
this very day for his journies; for his pleasures; nay, even for
his vices; and aggravates every sin by the abuse of <i>that</i>
which was intended to heal it; to give him time and repose for
self-examination; and to enable him the better to make up the
solemn account of every action, word, and thought, between
himself and God?</p>
<p>God blessed the Sabbath-day, and sanctified it for his own
glory; but how does it promote his glory, whilst the generality
of his faithless, ungrateful people, even in this Christian
nation, never enter his sacred courts on that day, to give him
the honour due unto his name in the presence of their
fellow-men.&nbsp; And &ldquo;shall I not visit for this, saith
the Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; Much, indeed, very much is it to be
feared, that he <i>will</i> visit, with some terrible calamity
too, and soon also, this country of ours, so dear to us all, so
much our boast and pride, which he has hitherto guarded with an
extraordinary protection, and exalted above other nations with
unparalleled renown and power.&nbsp; The <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>breach, the
dishonouring of his Sabbaths, he will keenly resent, and
unsparingly avenge.&nbsp; What he denounced to the Jews should
perpetually sound in our ears&mdash;&ldquo;Verily my Sabbaths
shall ye keep for a perpetual covenant; they are a sign between
<i>me</i> and <i>you</i> throughout your generations for ever;
that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.&nbsp;
They are holy unto you; every one that defileth them shall surely
be put to death.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a despite done to God
himself, directly and personally; it is a scorn both of his
majesty and his goodness, which cannot but provoke him to consume
the guilty in his wrath.</p>
<p>Already, indeed, do we feel his wrath in part executed upon
us, and in part behold it with terror suspended over us.&nbsp;
The nightly incendiary, who prowls about in darkness (but God
sees him) and destroys the fruits of the earth, which should have
been for the food of man; the open rioter, who, in broad
day-light, levels with the ground the temple of God, the marts of
commerce, the mansions of the great, and puts to the hazard even
the life of his beneficent neighbour; the wide-wasting
pestilence, which, with havoc and death in its train, has reached
the opposite shores, and now only waits the signal to cross the
sea to ours; all these are the avenging emissaries of God; but
the last <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>more apparently; and I pray God, as King David did, that
<i>we</i> may fall into <i>his</i> hands rather than into the
hands of men&mdash;yet He, who stilleth the fury of the warring
elements, can also still &ldquo;the madness of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the great question for <i>you</i>, and which you should
lay your hands upon your hearts, and answer conscientiously, is
this; how much <i>you</i> yourselves, individually, have
contributed to increase the mass of the national guilt in this
particular, of which God is so jealous.&nbsp; As my sacred office
compels me to speak the truth, and forbids every kind of flattery
and dissimulation; as I cannot otherwise be useful to any of you,
or assist you in working out your salvation, but by bearing
witness to the truth; as I am, moreover, now about to leave you
for a while, and therefore wish to give you some departing,
farewell advice of the most momentous importance; I say it, I
confess, with deep sorrow, and with a painful alarm on
<i>your</i> account, that, even in this otherwise well-disposed
and well-ordered parish, there is a too evident, and a too great,
neglect of the Sabbath.&nbsp; In the true spirit of pastoral
affection, but in the plain, manly, authoritative language of an
Apostle, I say, &ldquo;I cannot praise you in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Alas!
alas! what correct idea, or right devout feeling of God&rsquo;s
sabbaths, can <i>they</i> have, who are always absent from
God&rsquo;s house, and who, perhaps, profane these sacred days,
besides, by drunkenness, or gaming, or some other revelry?&nbsp;
None, undoubtedly.&nbsp; But all <i>our</i> remonstrances from
this sacred place must, of necessity, be useless to <i>them</i>;
they need them most, but are never present to hear them.&nbsp; Of
the rest, how few come here with so much regularity as to show
that it is an essential part of their system of life&mdash;an
established principle of conduct never to be departed from but
upon the most urgent, extraordinary occasions!&nbsp; And how will
God judge of <i>them</i>, who think that they do sufficient
honour to his Sabbath by coming once only, and forget that God
may construe their coming but once as a proud assumption on their
parts, that they want no more of his sanctifying grace than once
a day may be likely to bestow!&nbsp; If the help of the Holy
Spirit alone can fit them for salvation, and this help is chiefly
given by the ministry of the church, how can they be perfectly
satisfied with themselves, and think that they have done enough,
when they neglect, once a day, an opportunity of partaking of the
spirit, which the church is the instrument to <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>convey?&nbsp;
I am not unaware of the circumstances of this parish, which
render more sometimes impossible; but how few, how very few,
perhaps two or three individuals, lament those circumstances, and
the consequent loss of additional means of grace!</p>
<p>But how will God judge even of the most exemplary in any
congregation, who never forsake his house, either for pleasure,
or for business, or for any of those plausible reasons by which
men are too willing to delude themselves to their own ruin; if
they spend the rest of the day, nevertheless, as they spend the
other days of the week, and do not remember the Sabbath, to keep
it holy throughout; if they do not devote the whole of it with a
sober, religious awe to God; if they do not send their children
and servants to church with the same punctuality as they go
themselves; if they do not shun all the resorts of sensuality and
gaiety abroad, or admit such inmates at home; if they do not
study the Holy Scriptures, and put aside all other books but such
as may tend to build them up in faith and piety; and, in short,
if they do not live on this one day, in conformity with the
sacred nature of the day, so uniformly and so universally, as to
throw a sanctity around <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the lawful business and the lawful
pleasures of every other day, and gradually to make their whole
life truly Christian, truly divine, and fit, indeed, for
heaven.</p>
<p>Now, if they do not accomplish all this, whatever else they
do, they fall short of a due observance of the Sabbath; and who
is there, even amongst the most exemplary, alas! who ever thinks
of accomplishing so much?&nbsp; Alas, alas! who is there amongst
any of us, who, in some way or other, does not absolutely break
the Sabbath, or even profane it?&nbsp; And what wonder, then,
that there should be so much looseness, licentiousness, and
depravity of manners in our nation; and that so many evils assail
us, so many impend over our heads, and threaten us with some
mighty ruin?&nbsp; Sabbath-breaking has led to the temporal and
eternal ruin of thousand and tens of thousands; it cannot but
lead to the deeper corruption of all; to the gradual undermining
and ultimate extinction of all religious principle in the heart
of man.&nbsp; When a people cast off their respect for
God&rsquo;s Sabbaths, they are prepared to run the full career of
irreligion, and of profligacy, and of all the atrocities which
scourge and afflict mankind.</p>
<p>There are persons in this congregation old <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>enough to
remember, as I do, a whole powerful nation, our nearest
neighbours, casting it off, as it appeared, with one consent,
and, by cruelties almost unheard of before, compelling their
spiritual pastors and ministers to fly into exile; neither
religion, nor the semblance of religion being tolerated any
longer among them.&nbsp; And what was the issue?&nbsp; This
amazing apostacy was followed immediately by such deeds of
horror, by such tragical excesses, as will never be blotted out
of the annals of time.&nbsp; But the same impious means have been
industriously used to produce the same subversion of principle
here amongst <i>us</i> at home; and, God knows, they have but too
well succeeded with too many; so that we can scarcely exult any
longer with our former honourable pride, that our country is as
renowned for religion, for piety and virtue, for good order and
submission to authority, and for the deep abhorrence of all
atrocities, as she is for freedom, for wealth, for victory, and
for power.</p>
<p>Finally, then, in bidding you farewell, I earnestly beseech
you all, and through <i>you</i> I beseech the rest who are under
my spiritual charge, to ponder most deeply and seriously, and to
lay to heart also, what God himself spoke with <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>such terrible
signs of his power, and what his divine finger wrote for an
everlasting memorial; what He decreed in the beginning of time
when He rested from his marvellous works, and pronounced them
good; and what our blessed Saviour, the fulfiller of all
righteousness, obeyed in the true spirit of the command, and set
the pattern to every succeeding generation of Christians; I
earnestly beseech you all to &ldquo;remember the sabbath-day, to
keep it holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And let the first proof of your
remembrance of it, and the first act of keeping it holy, be your
constant attendance here in God&rsquo;s house&mdash;a practice
which will lead you on step by step to every other good
work.&nbsp; Let your ministers lament no more the thin attendance
of their hearers, in the afternoons especially.&nbsp; Come as
often as you may, you will scarcely return without being the
better and the wiser for it.&nbsp; I speak not of worldly wisdom,
but of the wisdom which will save your souls.&nbsp; What blessing
is there, of which you stand in need?&nbsp; Come here, and pray
for it in concert with the whole assembly&mdash;your united
prayers, with one mind and heart, ascending to God, will fetch
every blessing down.&nbsp; Is there any blessing of which you
feel the enjoyment?&nbsp; Come here, and thank God for it before
your fellow-men.&nbsp; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Are you ignorant of any of the great
gospel-doctrines which are necessary to be known?&nbsp; Come
here, and they will be explained, each in its proper season, and
you will be instructed to have a due and awful sense of their
importance.&nbsp; Have you been seduced into sin; do your
devotions become languid; do you neglect any duty; is your
benevolence cold?&nbsp; Come to God&rsquo;s house, and you will
hear discourses, it is to be hoped, as well as striking passages
of scripture, which will awaken and arouse you; keep heaven
always in your sight; fill you with heavenly affections; and
prepare you to dwell in some heavenly mansion with the blessed
saints of God.&nbsp; <i>We</i>, your ministers, I trust, amidst
all the discouragements with which we are surrounded, the entire
absence of so many, the apparent lukewarmness of others, preach,
nevertheless, with the same zeal as if we preached to multitudes
athirst for the word of God, and do not abate one tittle in our
fervent desire for <i>your</i> everlasting salvation.&nbsp; The
more, indeed, men neglect themselves, the more should the
ministers of Christ care for them, and stir up every faculty
which they have to rescue them from their dream of false
security.&nbsp; Let not this labour of <i>ours</i> be in
vain!&nbsp; Labour for yourselves as <i>we</i> labour for you;
all <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of us
alike, however, trusting to a greater strength than our
own.&nbsp; And I pray God, that, under the influence of the
Divine strength, and guided by his Holy Spirit, <i>you</i> may
become the crown of <i>our</i> labours, and enable us to give up
the account of our stewardship over you with joy.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
